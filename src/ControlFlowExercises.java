/*todo: Loop Basics - while: 1. create an integer variable i with a value of 5
                             2. create a while loop that runs so long as i is less than or equal to 15
                             3. each loop iteration, output the current value of i, then increment i by one
  output should be: 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
