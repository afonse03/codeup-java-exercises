// mini exercise #1 on 9/10/21
// todo: create a class for your favorite type of animal. The class should be named for your animal. It should have two instance variables - name and sound - and one method - makeNoise(). The output of the makeNoise method should be name + "goes" + sound. Create a test class with a main method to instantiate and test your class code.
public class HorsesExercise {
    String name;
    String sound;

    public void makeNoise() {
        System.out.println(name + " goes " + sound);
    }
}


// mini exercise #4 on 9/10/21
// todo: modify your animal class so that the name and noise are initiated during object construction, and the animal makes a noise when it is created.

// mini exercise #5 on 9/10/21
// todo: Encapsulate your animal class. Use your test class to verify that your instance variables cannot be directly accessed and can only be accessed through your getters and setters.
