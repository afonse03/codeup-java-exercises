/*
Instructions: continued from warmup on 9/17/21

Create a class, StringTransformerTest, with a main method: For the last part of the warm up, you will need to add both StringTransformer objects to an array before using a loop to print out the return value of the transform method.
  - add a main method to create a instances of both subclasses of the parent type with test strings
  - use a loop to print out the transformed versions of the strings
