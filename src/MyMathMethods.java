// todo: create a class called MyMathMethods. create a method in there called multiply. have it take two integer parameters and return the product of the two integers. do not create a main method in your class. create a test class, and run your multiply method from a main method in your test class. bonus: you can overload the method with a version that takes doubles instead of ints as its parameters. another bonus: refactor so the multiply method is static, then refactor your test so as to use the static method. another bonus: get input from user


public class MyMathMethods {
    public int multiply(int x, int y) {
        return x * y;
    }
}
